#Problem Statement: 
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other 
words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also 
given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset 
is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

#Input Of Program:
In this program we have taken no of object you wants to take then we take capacity of our knapsack after we have
taken two array to store weight and profit for each object and we are using 0/1 knapsack so fraction is not allowed so 
we cannot use greedy approch so in this we are going to use Dynamic Programming in this . 
time complexity of 0/1 knapsack in this is O(MN)	where M=capacity of our knapsack and N=No of object we have.
Auxiliary Space: O(N).

#Final Output:
In our final output we get optimal solution with less time complexity than our brute force algorithm with out time
complexity as O(MN)	where M=capacity of our knapsack and N=No of object we have.

#Conclusion:
A simple solution is to consider all subsets of items and calculate the total weight and value of all subsets. Consider the only subsets whose total weight is smaller than W. From all such subsets, pick the maximum value subset.

1) Optimal Substructure:
To consider all subsets of items, there can be two cases for every item: (1) the item is included in the optimal subset, (2) not included in the optimal set.
Therefore, the maximum value that can be obtained from n items is max of following two values.
1) Maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W weight (excluding nth item).
2) Value of nth item plus maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W minus weight of the nth item (including nth item).

If weight of nth item is greater than W, then the nth item cannot be included and case 1 is the only possibility.

2) Overlapping Subproblems

It should be noted that the above function computes the same subproblems again and again. See the following recursion tree, K(1, 1) is being 
evaluated twice. Time complexity of this naive recursive solution is exponential (2^n).

In the following recursion tree, K() refers to knapSack().  The two 
parameters indicated in the following recursion tree are n and W. 
The recursion tree is for following sample inputs.
wt[] = {1, 1, 1}, W = 2, val[] = {10, 20, 30}

                       K(3, 2)         ---------> K(n, W)
                   /            \ 
                  /              \               
            K(2,2)                K(2,1)
          /       \                /    \ 
        /           \            /        \
       K(1,2)      K(1,1)       K(1,1)     K(1,0)
       /  \         /   \        /   \
     /      \     /       \      /    \

Recursion tree for Knapsack capacity 2 units and 3 items of 1 unit weight.
Since suproblems are evaluated again, this problem has Overlapping Subprolems property. So the 0-1 Knapsack problem has both properties 
(see this and this) of a dynamic programming problem. Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of same subproblems 
can be avoided by constructing a temporary array K[][] in bottom up manner.so we have implemented our code using dynamic programing
